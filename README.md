### Programming approach
I always write code reasonably. For instance, simplicity should be a primary goal when developing code, but it doesn't mean that every piece of code should be overly simplistic. There can be situations where some complexity is necessary to achieve specific performance or functionality goals. The key is to strike a balance between simplicity and functionality.
